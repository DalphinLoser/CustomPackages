    <releaseNotes>&gt; **Disclaimer** AdGuard for Windows is not an open-source project. We use Github as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on.  In this release, we have improved the efficiency and compatibility of our app by updating the WFP and TDI drivers. We have also redesigned the tray icons to give them a fresh new look. Finally, we have fixed some bugs and updated Corelibs.  ## Changelog  ## Fixes * The CPU usage is high when using AdGuard VPN in Selective mode with Ad Blocker and system DNS enabled [#4750](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4750) * Incorrect detection of filtered apps when Browser Assistant is used [#4680](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4680) * An incorrect rule is suggested when attempting to unblock Stealth Mode for a request [#4675](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4675) * Unnecessary filter localhost notification when connecting to AdGuard VPN [#4687](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4687) * The context menu theme for Filtering log does not change when switching the app theme [#4628](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4628) * Finished translating Advanced settings to Russian [#4704](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4704)  ## Design * Updated the uninstaller icon [#4599](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4599) * Improved the settings icon in the Filtering log to appear when filtering criteria are set [#4656](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4656)  ## Versions * Updated CoreLibs to v1.11.118 [#4762](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForWindows/issues/4762)  **AdGuard for Windows direct download links:**    â€‹[Release channel](https://agrd.io/windows)  [Beta channel](https://agrd.io/windows_beta)  [Nightly channel](https://agrd.io/windows_nightly)</releaseNotes>
