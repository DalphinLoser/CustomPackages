**1.5.2**

- Better playtime detection when binary is used by more than one game (ex: P5 Strikers '_game.exe_')
- Rumble should work in every game (force vibration state)
- Dependencies and few minor tweaks not worth mentioning.

**1.5.1**

- You can now override default location for souvenir screenshot/video in `cfg/options.ini` ([details](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher#souvenir_custom_dir))
- Languages : 
  + Added PT-PT (Portuguese from Portugal) (Thanks @gust500)
  + Updated brazilian, schinese
  + Layout overrides for the above languages
- Websocket: fix dummy test not on par with notification
- Playtime tracking : added  '_javaw.exe_'  to the binary blacklist
- Node/electron security update

**1.5.0** 

Experimental new features :

- Playtime tracking : Track how much time you have wasted playing a game 😂 

![playtime_tracking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14090532/103472770-06ec2480-4dc4-11eb-91fc-91f269558397.png)

_Game start/end detection works by checking process name with an automatically generated game binary list (expect a few hit and miss) and works only with game released on Steam for now_

- Video souvenir : record a short video of a few seconds using the hardware encoder of your GPU (= low performance hit) when you unlock an achievement. Like 'screenshot souvenir' feature but in video if you will ^_^

_Evolution of this would be to continuously record your game session and when you unlock an achievement to get for example the 10sec prior and the 10sec following. Much like what is done on console._

&lt;hr &gt;

- Achievement notification sound : added PS5, PS5 Platinum, Gog galaxy and removed discord
- Achievement notification now uses `Achievement Name / Achievement Description (if any)` instead of `Game Name / Achievement Name` and thus option to _show achievement description if any_ has been removed
- Minor toast notification layout tweaks because of the above, Windows 20H2 toast layout change and playtime tracking notification
- Minor achievement progression UI tweaks (toast, achievement list) to better display direct value and value normalized to %
- Searchbar now collapse only when empty
- Added keyboard shortcuts for searchbar :
  + [ CRTL+F ] open/close
  +  [ ESC ] reset field
- In 'achievement view', sort by time is now remembered
- Achievement timestamp display has been inverted from `date / from now on hover` to `from now / date on hover`
- Fix a potential (but rare due to other mitigating options) achievement notification spam due to the fact that a file access sometimes triggers a file change update
- SmartSteamEmu : handle games with huge amount of stats and achievements (like 500-ish)
- No longer wait for screenshot if you are not displaying it inside the toast (~1sec gain)
- The usual dependencies update

**1.4.2** 

- fix screenshot (souvenir) failure when using default %USERPROFILE% (1.4.0 regression; hopefully the last one ^^)
- electron 11

**1.4.1** 

- screenshot (souvenir) hotfix : watchdog would crash when taking a screenshot for some games in 1.4.0 (regression)
 NB: No longer overwrite an existing screenshot. This will be configurable at a later date.
*(if toasted souvenir is enabled in this case the notification will be displayed without the screenshot)*.

**1.4.0**

- Custom user avatar : from file, windows profile or steam (click / right-click on the avatar)
- Internal changes, dependencies and framework update

**1.3.7** 

- Improved support for some Steam emulators

- Codex emu achievement progression support updated to work with newest release
- Notification option "iconPrefetch" now defaults to true

**1.3.4** 

This is a very minor update

  + ALI213 older release (~2010)
  + Hoodlum using 'ALI213 like' emulator
  + Achievement api name doesn't match steam schema api name case
     _eg: New_Achievement_1 &lt;=&gt; NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_

**1.3.3** 
- Translation update

- Skidrow using hoodlum/darksiders emu support (via custom folder: select the folder where steam_api.ini is located)
- ALI213 : Now handle SaveType 0 &amp; 1 (This change the save data path location)
- ALI213, Hoodlum, Darksiders path finder is less strict. 
  This is so that missing ach file will be handled as 0% game (cf previous update)
- Added some cosmetic loading animations when building icon notification cache (iconPrefetch), generating achievements.json (Goldberg), scanning your drives (SmartFind) as these actions can take some time
- dependencies update (security)
